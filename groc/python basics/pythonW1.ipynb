    "\n",
    "**Introduction to Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and fun to use. It's a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write. Here are some basic syntax elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Indentation:** Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define block-level structure. This means that you need to indent your code using spaces or tabs to define the scope of a block.\n",
    "* **Comments:** Python uses the `#` symbol to start a comment. Anything after the `#` symbol on a line is ignored by the interpreter.\n",
    "* **Variables:** Python has a simple syntax for declaring variables. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (`=`).\n",
    "* **Operators:** Python has a range of operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate data. Here are some of the most common data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integers:** Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
    "* **Floats:** Floats are decimal numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.5.\n",
    "* **Strings:** Strings are sequences of characters, such as \"hello\" or 'hello'. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.\n",
    "* **Boolean:** Booleans are true or false values.\n",
    "* **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections of items, such as [1, 2, 3] or [\"hello\", \"world\"].\n",
    "* **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, such as {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}.\n",
